A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

Welcome to my Integration project! This project aims to demonstrate the seamless integration of Python, SQL, and Power BI for data analysis and visualization purposes. By combining these powerful tools, we can efficiently manipulate, query, analyze, and visualize data from various sources.
## Project Overview

In this project, i leveraged Python for data extraction, transformation,. And utilized SQL for data querying and manipulation within relational databases. Finally, we employ Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports based on the processed data.



## Steps to Create Project 

### Fake Data Generation (Python)

The first step in the project involved generating fake data using Python. We used libraries such as faker to create realistic-looking data for customers, orders, and suppliers.

To generate fake data using Python, follow these steps:
1. Install the required libraries: pip install faker.
2. Run the Python script generate_fake_data.py to generate fake data.

### Database Creation (SQL)

After generating fake data, we created a SQL database to store the data. We used SQLite for simplicity, but you can use any SQL database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

To create the SQL database:
1. Execute the SQL script create_database.sql to create the database schema.
2. Import the generated fake data into the database tables.

### Power BI Dashboard

Finally, we built a Power BI dashboard to visualize the data stored in the SQL database. Power BI provides powerful tools for creating interactive dashboards and reports.
#### Creation of Power BI Dashboard 

To create the Power BI dashboard:
1. Connect Power BI to the SQL database.
2. Import the necessary tables from the database.
3. Design and create visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to analyze the data.
4. Arrange the visualizations on the dashboard canvas to provide insights into key metrics and trends.
