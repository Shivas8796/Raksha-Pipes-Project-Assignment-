# RAKSHA PIPES REPORT

## Project Overview
A demonstration of Python, SQL, and Power BI integration for data analysis and visualization.

## Data Generation
### Fake Data Generation (Python)
- Utilized Python libraries such as faker to generate realistic-looking data for customers, orders, and suppliers.
- The first step in the project involved generating fake data using Python. We used libraries such as faker to create realistic-looking data for customers, orders, and suppliers.

To generate fake data using Python, follow these steps:
1. Install the required libraries: pip install faker.
2. Run the Python script generate_fake_data.py to generate fake data.


## Database Design
### Database Creation (SQL)
- Created a SQL database using SQLite to store generated fake data.
- Executed SQL script create_database.sql to establish the database schema.
- Imported the generated fake data into the appropriate database tables.
- 
After generating fake data, we created a SQL database to store the data. We used SQLite for simplicity, but you can use any SQL database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

To create the SQL database:
1. Execute the SQL script create_database.sql to create the database schema.
2. Import the generated fake data into the database tables.


## Dashboard Creation
### Power BI Dashboard
- Connected Power BI to the SQL database.
- Imported necessary tables for analysis.
- Designed visualizations including bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards.
- Arranged visualizations on the dashboard canvas to provide insights into key metrics and trends.
